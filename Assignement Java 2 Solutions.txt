1. Conditional operators in Java are used to perform comparisons and make decisions based on conditions. The main conditional operators in Java are:
== (equal to)
!= (not equal to)
< (less than)
> (greater than)
<= (less than or equal to)
>= (greater than or equal to)

2. Operators in Java can be categorized based on the number of operands they require:
Arithmatic operators: Operate on two operand.
Relational operators: Operate on two operand
Unary operators: Operate on a single operand.
Ternary operator: Operates on three operands.

3. The switch case statement in Java is used to execute one block of code from multiple options based on the value of a expression.

4. The priority levels of arithmetic operations in Java, from highest to lowest precedence, are as follows:
(i) Parentheses ()
(ii) Unary operators (-, +)
(iii) Multiplication *, Division /, Modulus %
(iv) Addition +, Subtraction -

5. Conditional statements in Java are used to execute code based on certain conditions. The main types of conditional statements in Java are:
if statement
if-else statement
switch statement

6.The syntax of the if statement in Java is as follows:
if (condition) {
    // code to be executed if the condition is true
}

7.The three types of iterative statements in Java are:
for loop
while loop
do-while loop

8.The main difference between the for loop and the do-while loop in Java is that the loop body of do while will be executed atleast once.

    public static void main(String[]args)
    {
        for(int i=1;i<=10;i++)
        {
           system.out.println(i);
        }
    }
